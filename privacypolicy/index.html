            <p>2.1. Alice is an AI-powered fashion platform that customizes outfit recommendations based on your energy, mood, and style preferences.

            <p>3.4. If we discover an account belonging to a minor, we reserve the right to require proof of legal age. Failure to provide sufficient proof will result in termination of your Account and deletion of your data.</p>
            
            <p>3.5. Each user is limited to one Account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. Failure to comply may result in the termination of your Account.</p>
